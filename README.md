# 📊 Task 1: Population Data Analysis

## 📌 Objective
To analyze the global population trends from 1960 to 2024 and visualize growth patterns across countries and regions.

## 🛠️ Steps Performed
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Visualization of global population trends  
4. Comparative analysis between countries and regions  
5. Identified growth hotspots and insights  

## 📈 Visualizations

- Country-wise comparisons (bar charts)  
- Heatmap of population change over time  

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## 🚀 Outcome
